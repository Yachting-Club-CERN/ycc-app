        The page you are looking for does not seem to exist. No worries though,
        our boats are definitely found in Versoix (at least during the season).

        If you feel the boogie you can send this to the IT Helpers:
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'}}>{toJson(debug)}</Typography>
    </>
  );
};

export default NotFound;
